#''''''Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and 
#    then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed
#    in a comma separated sequence. Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 Notes:
#                Assume the data is input by console.''''''
